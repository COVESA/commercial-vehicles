    Level 5 and 4 ADS (Automated driving system) disengage, if appropriate, only after
    it achieves a minimal risk condition or a driver is performing the DDT. Level
    3 ADS disengages either an appropriate time after issuing a request to intervene
    or immediately upon user request. Level 2 DAS (Driving automation system) disengages
    immediately upon driver request. However, since many Level 2 DAS, often termed
    "Level 2.5", warn the driver shortly before reaching their operational limits,
    the VSS also supports the DISENGAGING state for SAE_2. Nevertheless, it should
    be noted that the SAE J3016 states that it is incorrect to describe driving automation
    features using fractional levels.
